[x] set up github repo (private) : 
	https://github.com/completelyAbsorbed/amazon-musical-instrument-reviews
[x] set up local repo : 
	C:\Users\liz\iCloudDrive\code\AmazonMusicalInstruments\data_AmazonMusicalInstruments
[x] gather relevant process maps from Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate course :
	(outline plan for this project in PACE format below)
	PACE - Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute - workflow for data projects
		Plan - for the planning stage of this project I ...
			mapped out my plan (in this tracker)
			reviewed stakeholder requirements (information from recruiter and job posting)
			researched possible datasets to work with and settled on one (AMZN Musical Instruments)
		Analyze - assemble the data and decide on how to approach the problem at-hand 
			download data
			inspect data
			clean data 
			perform EDA
			identify interesting areas to explore 
			settle on a path or path(s) to explore for the purposes of this project 
		Construct - build the project ...
			deliverables : 
				a clean Jupyter notebook to walk through with interviewers
				actual presentation of the code in interview, speaking to 
					principles (i.e. readable code, variable naming)
					best-practices (i.e. documentation)
					patterns of software design (i.e. object-oriented and/or functional programming)
				version control of this project showing ...
					use of git and commandline
					progress in problem-solving approach 
					competent use of version control 
		Execute - convey the appropriate results and information to stakeholders (interviewers)
			walk through my code with interviewers
			share notebook and private github repo with interviewers
			invite follow-ups, questions, clarifications
[x] decide on dataset :

- I walked to the park, reviewed the email from the recruiter for a position I had an upcoming 
	technical interview for, wrote down key things to prepare for interview based on recruiter's 
	instruction and job posting, drafted an initial plan 
- set up github private repo via github CLI
- reviewed potential datasets to work with - decided on the Amazon Musical Instruments reviews 
	dataset from searching Kaggle to illustrate transforming semistructured/unstructured data in the
	form of text reviews etc
